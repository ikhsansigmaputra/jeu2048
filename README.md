# jeu2048
This repository contains the files needed to play the game 2048 which I wrote in C. In the development, I separate the functions and procedures into several files:
a. functions
b. interface
c. main file

There are basically 2 version : 
1. 2048 basic 
2. 2048 with library ncurses

Both versions use the same function file but different interface file and main file.
